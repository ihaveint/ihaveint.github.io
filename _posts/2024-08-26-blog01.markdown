I realize that so much of my identity is defined by "not losing".
And that's a bit messed up for many reasons. But I'm going to talk about two here:

1. There are a bunch of things that I've never tried to do seriously because I couldn't convince myself that I could do them properly. I pretty much gave up before trying. Just to protect that identity of being someone who doesn't lose. As I'm becoming a bit older, I'm realizing that I actually wanted to do some of those things, and it's very hard to do after so many years of building that identity.

2. As you do more and more things, you'll have higher expectations for what you can do. But at some point, you're going to mess something up! I feel like a total failure when that happens, even though it's a success in and of itself that I've been able to raise the bar this high in the first place.

I probably should start being more mindful about why I do (or don't do) things from now on. I never thought it would backfire like this.Â
