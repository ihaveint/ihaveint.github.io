What happens when you hit a ceiling?

One valuable lesson I learned from a mentor of mine was that most challenges in life are like a glass, but we tend to think of them as a ceiling! When you hit an obstacle, if you think of it as a ceiling, you'll stop trying. But if you think of it as a glass, it's just a matter of how many times you need to hit it with enough force before it shatters. And it will shatter; the only question is if you persevered enough!

It's such an easy concept, but I always find myself coming back to it when things get hard. I often combine it with another strong core belief of mine: the harder something is, the happier you should be! That simply means most people have given up by now. I like things to be hard. If they're not, I get uncomfortable. My edge is knowing I can be put in a harder situation compared to the majority of people. And I want it to be that way. You can train yourself to enjoy it, and while I used to think there might be something wrong with me for being this way, I was just not using it as my competitive advantage.
