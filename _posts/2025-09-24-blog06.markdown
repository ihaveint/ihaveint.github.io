Why I think consistency matters when thinking about delayed consequences,



It hurts a lot when you try to change a certain aspect of your life dramatically, and then after a little while, you compare yourself to where you were before your big commitment, and see little to no changes. It might discourage you to the point where you stop the new habit altogether. But the mistake here is not considering the fact that when we change a behavior or a certain way we do something, it might take a good amount of time before we see ANY results. It's just a matter of staying consistent, and perhaps even doubling down. As somebody who overthinks a lot, this has been hard for me since I get into thinking: "Well, in an ideal scenario I'd see some good results. But what if I'm doing the wrong thing and I won't actually see the result I want?". The reality is, you'd never know unless you wait long enough. Life is short, and you do have to make trade-offs. But if you think you should do something, just do it. Don't think about the result for a while. You're better than that :)
