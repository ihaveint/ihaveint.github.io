Can be anything else, really...

We are often limited by not only the number of years or how long we've been exposed to things, but also the number of different ways we've been exposed to them. And most people, myself included, often overlook that important fact.

I honestly don't have much to add to it. I think it also ruins the advice to ramble about it :) But what I would like to add is that we as humans love "feeling" like we're being productive by leveraging the fact that we've been doing something for so long, and because we're now adequate at it, we are therefore "productive" when engaging with it, or "expert" in that subject. But why should it even be the goal? Like, why do you even want to feel like you're an expert? Why don't you optimize for something else? So I'll end this blog on a tangent that I stole from somebody, where they asked me:

"What do you optimize for in life?".
