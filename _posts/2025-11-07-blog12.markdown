When you get to the top of the mountain, but see another mountain in front of you...

I've always been the kind of person who wants to climb a mountain in life. It could be a new achievement, a new goal that I want to conquer, or simply anything I want to achieve in life. Then, after a while, reality sets in: how far I am from achieving what I want. And being in that low period for a while, I almost always fall into the fallacy of thinking that "If I get it one day, then I'll be happy". 

Ang guess what? I've always gotten almost anything I wanted out of life (without a few exceptions, of course), and I've always felt pretty much the same, or even worse, compared to when I even had the seed in my mind that I wanted this thing to happen in the first place.
